I have been working in large-scale software and web infrastructure
for the past $years years.  I'm an avid supporter of open-source
development and am particularly interested in DevOps and dev strategies
in general.

I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and tools. The ones I
favor most include:

    for lang in $LANGUAGES; do
        echo " - $lang"
    done
    echo

    cat << EOF
And finally some unsolicited advice:
1. Don't blindly run random scripts you find on the internet (shame ðŸ””).
2. Avoid turning your workstation into critical infra.
3. Automate anything and everything.
